    "description": "\n\n## AIP rationale\n\nAs stated in the [Aavenomics paper](https://aave.com/Aavenomics.pdf), the AAVE asset is designed to become the center of gravity for Aave governance and the protocol.\n\n\nThe DeFi decentralized ethos has been mostly achieved with protocols on the financial side, creating an ecosystem of financial applications with users in control of their own assets. However, we believe that is only the halfway point of the decentralization objective. Users should also be be in control of the protocol. The AAVE asset is designed for this purpose. This AIP is the first binding step towards the community ownership of the Aave Protocol.\n\n\nThis AIP, if accepted by the community, will slowly deprecate the LEND asset in favour of the AAVE asset. As stated in the Aavenomics, this token upgrade will also create the Ecosystem Reserve (ER), the Safety Module (SM), and start the Safety Incentive (SI) rewards distribution. The Safety Module is designed as an additional line of defense for Aave liquidity providers and as a way for AAVE holders to \"stake\" their assets in exchange for a range of rewards.\n\n\nThis AIP's purpose is also to dedicate a part of the ER to a kickstart incentives for the Safety Module's first quarterly staker distribution.\n\n## AIP content in short\n\n- Migration of LEND -> AAVE asset with the migration contract\n- Activation of the quarterly plan of Safety Incentives (SI) allocation\n- Start of the Safety Module with initial SI rewards of 400 AAVE/day\n\n## Safety Incentives Schedule\n\nThe bootstrapping phase of the Safety Module will be a step-by-step process in 2 main phases:\n- Initial bootstrapping with launch of the Safety Module, the ability to stake and earn AAVE rewards, but no activation of the protocol protection (i.e slashing) and thus risk-free for stakers.\n- Activation of the Safety Module, a new line of defense for the Aave Protocol users.\n\nThe initial bootstrapping phase rationale is designed to have lower rewards and a risk-free environment to allow the majority of LEND holders to migrate at their own pace. This encourages a careful approach while interacting with critical migration and staking smart-contracts.\n\nAfter activation of the Safety Module, the Aave governance can adjust the Safety Incentive (SI) schedule and emissions rate.\n\nThe Safety Incentive's allocation quarterly date should be voted on before the end of the 3 months (90 days) distribution schedule. In the case of a late or no vote on a new SI allocation plan, the current allocation will continue until a vote or until the ER is empty.\n\n## Mainnet addresses and relevant notes\n\nIf this AIP is validated by a community vote, the following addresses will be involved in the migration process :\n\n- [0x8a2efd9a790199f4c94c6effe210fce0b4724f52](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8a2efd9a790199f4c94c6effe210fce0b4724f52) AaveProtoGovernance : the governance contract\n- [0x7Fc66500c84A76Ad7e9c93437bFc5Ac33E2DDaE9](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9#code) AAVE token contract : the ERC20 AAVE token contract\n- [0x4da27a545c0c5b758a6ba100e3a049001de870f5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4da27a545c0c5b758a6ba100e3a049001de870f5) StakedAave : The Staking contract for AAVE\n- [0x317625234562b1526ea2fac4030ea499c5291de4](https://etherscan.io/address/0x317625234562b1526ea2fac4030ea499c5291de4) LendToAaveMigrator : The migration contract\n- [0x95a4949f09415b12da789e144b2522956620d005](https://etherscan.io/address/0x95a4949f09415b12da789e144b2522956620d005) AaveGenesisPayloadProposal : Contract in charge of enforcement of the AIP outcome\n- [0xa133459b2502b0137e85a446fa8d4e300877a007](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa133459b2502b0137e85a446fa8d4e300877a007) AaveGenesisExecutor : Contract enforcing a 24h delay on enforcement of AIP outcome to allow the community to be prepared to migrate\n- [0x25f2226b597e8f9514b3f68f00f494cf4f286491](https://etherscan.io/address/0x25f2226b597e8f9514b3f68f00f494cf4f286491#code) AaveIncentivesVault : Ecosystem Reserve\n\n\nThe migration process for every LEND holder will leverage the method `migrateFromLend()` with a simple `uint256` input of the amount.

    "description": "\n\n## AIP rationale\n\nThe Aave protocol V1 included the possibility to burn LEND tokens by collecting flashloan premiums and borrowing fees. Up until now, 2.5M LEND have been burned, which will not be converted to AAVE.\nAs a result of the migration, the LEND liquidity has shrunk considerably, which makes it very hard to buy LEND on dexes for the burning.\n\nThe LEND burner currently holds around 20K of funds, distributed across all the different Aave V1 reserves (mostly stablecoins). The burner contract is here https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3d9988f676457123c5fd01297605efdd0cba1ae \n\nThis AIP proposes to stop the LEND burning. Instead, the idea is to collect the fees accrued by AAVE V1 to bootstrap a protocol fund. \n\n## AIP content in short\n\n- Deprecation of the current TokenDistributor contract\n- Implementation of the following strategy instead of burning:\n  \n  1. Remove the assets conversion to LEND and subsequent burning\n  2. The assets are moved to the AAVE Collector contract, under direct control of the AAVE governance (https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c)\n\n- The implementation will keep the current redistribution of the referral fees (20% of the total) to continue with the referral distribution as until now.\n\n## Implementation details\n\n- Upgrade of the TokenDistributor contract https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3d9988f676457123c5fd01297605efdd0cba1ae \n- Modify the distribute() function as follows:\n\n  1.

Move the assets to 0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n\nDistribution to the current referral fees wallet will be kept.\n  \n## Proposal data\n\nAIP2 Payload:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x4b7c3e3ea48f80a78487067cd08b9a8430eb8eb5\n\nNew TokenDistributor Implementation:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x62C936a16905AfC49B589a41d033eE222A2325Ad\n\nAave Collector contract:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "basename": "AIP-4",
    "description": "\n\n## AIP rationale\n\nAave V2 governance is inspired by delegation-based governance models already on the market, while introducing 3 key innovations and a new layer of resilience:\n\nThe introduction of a new concept in DeFi governance - the **segregation between voting and proposition power** to increase control and ownership of voting rights for AAVE holders.\nAAVE holders will have the choice between delegating proposal creation power to specialized actors while holding their voting rights; or even delegating them to another entity.\n\n**Voting strategies** - The AAVE token exists and is used in the Aave ecosystem in a variety of ways. Through different voting strategies, AAVE in different forms can be used to vote and create proposals. In the initial implementation both AAVE and stkAAVE holders will have voting and proposal creation rights. Voting strategies can be upgraded at any time through a governance proposal to include other forms of AAVE (i.e. aAAVE, staked AAVE/ETH AMM shares, etc.)\n\n**Multiple executor entities** - Different components of the ecosystem might have different needs for consensus and security. For example, changing the AAVE token logic itself might have a large impact on the ecosystem and is something that requires higher consensus than adjusting a risk management parameter. The Aave governance V2 splits the control of different entities within the Aave ecosystem between different executors with different execution delays (timelocks) and different consensus parameters. At the beginning there will be two different executors:\n\n**a.** Executor 1 (short timelock) will control the whole Aave Protocol v1, the token distributor used in v1, the contract collecting the v1 fees, the AAVE Reserve Ecosystem and any change in this timelock itself. Once the break-in period for Aave V2 is completed, this timelock will also control the current Aave V2 market and all the future markets instantiated by the Aave Genesis Team.\n\n- admin : Aave Governance v2\n- delay : 1 day\n- grace period : 5 days\n- proposition threshold: 0.5%\n- voting duration: 3 days\n- vote differential: 0.5%\n- Approval quorum: 2%\n\n**b.** Executor 2 (long timelock) will control the upgradeability of the AAVE token, stkAAVE, any change in v2 governance parameters and any change in the parameters of this timelock itself.\n\n- admin: Aave Governance v2\n- delay: 7 days\n- grace period: 5 days\n- proposition threshold: 2%\n- voting duration: 10 days\n- vote differential: 15%\n- Approval quorum: 20%\n\nThe Guardian - As long as a large majority of AAVE tokens are in a centralised exchange, it’s impossible to prevent a STEEM-like governance attack where a centralised entity would use its users’ assets to take over a decentralised protocol through governance. As a security measure to avoid such a scenario, a temporary 5/10 multisig is given a power of veto to cancel proposals in case malicious code is introduced through an AIP. Those entities have been chosen within the AAVE community to be globally distributed, and they cover safety skill sets through governance, code, and economic analysis. Guardians can be changed later through election.\nThe current multisig signers are : James Vaugh (Fire Eyes/Metacartel), Anthony Sassano (SET protocol/ETHhub/Daily Gwei), Mariano Conti (ex MakerDAO head of smart contracts), Tarun Chitra (Gauntlet), DeFiSaver, Zerion, Parafi Capital, Framework Venture, Arthur0x and the Aave Genesis Team\nSome of the expected short-term outcomes of this implementation are new actors creating proposals for token additions, risk parameter upgrades or new liquidity market creation.\n\n## AIP content in short\n\n- Implementation of the Aave Governance v2 smart contract\n- Implementation of voting delegation and proposal power delegation\n- Implementation of voting strategies with the inclusion of AAVE and StkAAVE\n- Addition of voting and proposition power delegations on AAVE and SktAAVE\n- Implementation of Executor entities\n- Implementation of the Guardian\n\n\n## Implementation details\n\nCreating a Governance V1 Proposal vote with the proposal executor at https://etherscan.io/address/0xd194b24913806fc885f1fecd3e776f8449e5e24a#code\n\nIf the proposal passes:\n\na.

Curve offers an optimised model for stablecoin trading and revenue sharing incentives with fees from the >$10B in cumulative trading volume\n\n## CRV Smart Contract Risk: B-\nCRV token was introduced to Curve in August 2020 through liquidity mining. The code has 3 audits from ToB, Quantstamp and MixBytes. It is central in the DAO operations enabling stakers to vote and boost their yields with the locking of CRV. This model has generated half a billion transactions in half a year, with around 15,000 holders\n\n## CRV Counterparty Risk: B\nThe Curve DAO operates as a fully decentralised organisation with community proposals and votes. The ecosystem is funded by fees of the Curve Exchange generated by the $40m of daily volume\n\n## CRV Market Risk: C\nCurve is one of the leading DeFi projects. The token is available on top exchanges with nearly $100m market capitalisation and nearly as much average daily volume though a large share of CRV’s supply is locked. CRV experienced volatility in the last month with the rest of the market having yet to recover\nCRV’s risk profile is close to YFI’s leading to the same model parameters\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\n- LTV 40%\n- Liquidation Threshold 55%\n- Liquidation Bonus 15%\n- Reserve Factor 20%\n\n## Variable Interest Rate Model\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/chSyDxc.png\" />\n</p>\n\n\nCRV fits the profile of a collateral asset, with the need for a conservative borrow rate model with a low optimal utilisation to protect collateral liquidity\n\n- UOptimal 45%\n- R_0 0%\n- R_s1 7%\n- R_s2 300%\n\n### Code \nThe code is part of the standard Aave protocol deployment (the AToken, Debt tokens and interest rate strategy) therefore no audits are needed. The code can be found here https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/tree/master/contracts/protocol/tokenization\n\n### Test Cases \nBeing a standard ERC20, the Aave protocol test cases already cover everything needed to support CRV.\n\n### Security Considerations\nThe CRV token doesn’t have any specific behavior (eg. rebasing, balance increasing) and doesn’t offer meta governance functionalities since it requires locking to participate in the governance. Therefore, the standard AToken contract and corresponding debt tokens, already used for the majority of assets listed in Aave, can be also used for CRV. No auditing of the code is required.\n\n",

I have personally tested this out and was impressed with the results: withdraw of GUSD from Gemini exchange was sent within 1 minute using fast gas, and deposit back into Gemini was credited within ~17 block confirmation. It should be possible for liquidators (who are willing/able to KYC) to flip GUSD collateral directly through Gemini for the time being. GUSD also has a few trading pairs on other centralized exchanges such as OKEx, HitBTC, and ZB. I plan on submitting a proposal to create a GUSD Curve pool in the near future as well, if this is supported by veCRV voters the on-chain liquidity for GUSD should improve substantially.\n\n## Rationale\nBenefits for Aave:\n\nDiversification of centralized assets: GUSD relies on a different issuer and custodian compared to USDC, TUSD, USDT, or BUSD. Credit, custody, or regulatory risks may be less correlated across these assets, which could reduce risk to Aave security module stakers.\nNew DeFi on/off ramp: Gemini has good linkage with US bank wire and ACH networks, comparable to Coinbase as a fiat ramp.\nWhile Coinbase have played nice so far, it’s dominance in regulated crypto liquidity and USDC on/off ramp has huge influence over the space. I see Gemini and GUSD as a viable competitor. From an industrial economics standpoint, Aave and other Defi protocols like Maker may benefit from breaking down monopolies of their key counter-parties.\n\n## Risk Analysis\n\nThe Risk Team has applied Aave’s Risk Framework to GUSD leading to an overall risk rating of B-\n\nGUSD is issued by Gemini Trust Company. It has been created for practical use in innovative applications, among which to facilitate Gemini’s institutional solutions and exchange operations.\n\nGUSD Smart contract Risk: C+\n\nGUSD was launched in September 2018 – at the same time then USDC – yet it has only experienced 120k blockchain transactions.\n\nThe GUSD smart contract only supports 2 decimals meaning that interest accrual can only occur for more than 1 cent.\n\nUSDC Counterparty Risk: C+ cannot use as collateral (centralisation D-)\n\nAs it is backed by real US dollars, GUSD is centralised. Moreover it has few holders with most of the transactions off-chain on the centralised Gemini environment.\n\nAn independent accountant’s audit report is published at the end of each month on the website. GUSD is regulated bringing trust to the token. Still, the infrastructure is based on the Ethereum blockchain where regulators have little power.\n\nGUSD Market Risk: B -\n\nGUSD has a small market capitalisation at less than 20m with a small trading volume. The price has diverged from 1 a few times in the last 3 months with up to 3% price variation.\nGiven the reduced market capitalization and the possibility of market price manipulation, the oracle will fix the price of GUSD to $1. This does not bring additional risk because the asset cannot be used as collateral and even if the market price swings considerably, the asset is still redeemable 1:1 for USD. The risk team will reevaluate the asset periodically to validate the viability of an actual market based oracle as the GUSD supply grows.  \n\nRisk Parameters ~ BUSD sUSD\nNot a collateral\nReserve Factor 10%\n\nVariable Interest Rate Model ~ BUSD sUSD\nUOptimal 80%\n\nR_0 0%\n\nR_s1 4%\n\nR_s2 100%\n\n## References\n\n- *Whitepaper*: https://gemini.com/static/dollar/gemini-dollar-whitepaper.pdf\n- *Website*: https://gemini.com/dollar\n- *Twitter*: https://twitter.com/Gemini\n- *Source Code*: https://github.com/gemini/dollar\n- *GUSD token contract*: https://etherscan.io/token/0x056fd409e1d7a124bd7017459dfea2f387b6d5cd\n- *Accountant’s reports at bottom of page*: https://gemini.com/dollar#reports\n- *Trail of bits contract audit*: https://gemini.com/static/dollar/gemini-dollar-trailofbits-audit.pdf\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## AIP rationale\n\nOn the 25th of September 2020, with the results of AIP-1, the Aave protocol kickstarted its initial phase of Aavenomics and Safety Incentives with a scheduled distribution of 400 AAVE per day to Safety module stakers.\n\nWith the implementation of the Aave Protocol V2 and the soft deadline of first-quarter reached, this proposal will allow an upgrade of the reserve emission model for the Safety module.\n\nThis AIP will increase the responsibility of AAVE stakers for their service of protecting the Aave protocol by the formal activation of the slashing.\n\nThe slashing officially enforces the currently implicit responsibility and risk of the participation in the stakings modules of Aave. In the worst-case scenario of critical failure, an amount to be decided will be slashed from stakers deposits.\n\nIn this phase 0 of the slashing, the auction mechanism will not be automatized yet and if a slash were to happen it would be done through governance and direct compensation.\n\n\n## AIP content in short\n\n- Increasing the Safety Incentives: As the possibility of slashing will now be formally introduced, staking reward should reflect the risk. Hence we propose to increase the Safety Incentives to 550 AAVE per day\n- Slashing %: The maximum slashing amount is set to 30%\n\n\n## Implementation details\n\nThe payload to be executed is available at\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x4ab8ba929e4cc780cb82be34eea29a9ea7a58049#code\n\nThe payload will upgrade the Aave reserve contract to a new implementation\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xa335e2443b59d11337e9005c9af5bc31f8000714#code\n\nAnd introduce a reserve controller, with the rights of approving transfers/transferring assets out of the Aave Reserve, under control of the Aave governance short executor\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x1e506cbb6721b83b1549fa1558332381ffa61a93#code\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",
